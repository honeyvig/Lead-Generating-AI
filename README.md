# Lead-Generating-AI
I am looking for someone to help build 2 types of bots:

1. a list building AI for instagram specific types of instagram accounts and a DMing bot

2. a Google maps business lead generating bot to generate lists
======================
Building the bots you described involves combining web scraping, automation, and AI techniques. Let's break this down into the two bots you need:
1. Instagram List Building and DM Bot

This bot needs to:

    Search for Instagram accounts of specific types (e.g., niche categories, locations, hashtags).
    Build a list of relevant Instagram accounts.
    Send Direct Messages (DMs) to the users from the list.

For Instagram, you'll have to use the Instagram API (or third-party services like Instabot or Selenium-based automation). Keep in mind that Instagram has strict rules about automation and scraping, so any automation should comply with their terms of service.

For simplicity, we can use the instabot Python library for building the Instagram list and sending DMs.
1.1. Install Required Libraries

First, install the necessary libraries:

pip install instabot

1.2. Instagram List Building and DM Bot Code

from instabot import Bot
import time

# Initialize the bot with your credentials
bot = Bot()
bot.login(username="your_username", password="your_password")

# Function to build list of accounts based on a hashtag
def build_instagram_list(hashtag, num_posts=100):
    print(f"Building list for hashtag: {hashtag}")
    users = bot.get_hashtag_users(hashtag)[:num_posts]
    return users

# Function to send direct messages to the list of users
def send_dm_to_users(user_list, message="Hi, I love your profile!"):
    for user in user_list:
        print(f"Sending message to {user}")
        bot.send_message(message, [user])
        time.sleep(10)  # Sleep to avoid spamming and getting blocked

# Example usage
hashtag = "fashion"
user_list = build_instagram_list(hashtag, num_posts=50)
send_dm_to_users(user_list, message="Hi, I saw your profile, and I wanted to connect with you!")

Explanation:

    Login: The bot logs into your Instagram account using the credentials.
    List Building: The bot gathers users from posts under a specific hashtag (or you can modify it to search by location or profile type).
    DMing: The bot sends a direct message to each user in the list, with a short delay (time.sleep(10)) to avoid being flagged by Instagram's anti-bot measures.

Caution:

Automating DMs can lead to your account being flagged or banned. Make sure to not overuse the DM function and ensure you're not violating Instagram's policies. Using a bot for such tasks can risk your account being suspended, so use with caution.
2. Google Maps Business Lead Generating Bot

This bot can scrape Google Maps to gather business information based on certain search criteria (e.g., location, business type) and generate a list of leads.

Google Maps scraping is against Googleâ€™s terms of service, so instead of scraping, you can use the Google Places API to gather business data.
2.1. Install Required Libraries

pip install googlemaps

2.2. Google Maps Lead Generation Code

import googlemaps
import time

# Initialize Google Maps API client
api_key = 'your_google_maps_api_key'
gmaps = googlemaps.Client(key=api_key)

# Function to search for businesses on Google Maps by keyword and location
def search_businesses(query, location, radius=5000):
    places = gmaps.places(query=query, location=location, radius=radius)
    return places['results']

# Function to extract business details (name, address, phone number, etc.)
def extract_business_info(businesses):
    business_info = []
    for business in businesses:
        info = {
            'name': business.get('name'),
            'address': business.get('vicinity'),
            'location': business.get('geometry', {}).get('location'),
            'phone': business.get('formatted_phone_number', 'N/A')
        }
        business_info.append(info)
    return business_info

# Example usage
def generate_leads(query, location):
    businesses = search_businesses(query, location)
    leads = extract_business_info(businesses)
    
    for lead in leads:
        print(f"Business Name: {lead['name']}")
        print(f"Address: {lead['address']}")
        print(f"Phone: {lead['phone']}")
        print("-" * 50)
    
    return leads

# Example: Searching for 'restaurants' in New York
location = (40.7128, -74.0060)  # New York's latitude and longitude
query = 'restaurant'
business_leads = generate_leads(query, location)

Explanation:

    Google Places API: The gmaps.places() function queries Google Maps for businesses in a specific location based on the search query (e.g., "restaurant").
    Lead Generation: The generate_leads() function processes the results to extract business name, address, and phone number.

Important Notes:

    API Key: You need a Google Maps API key, which you can get by setting up a project in the Google Cloud Console.
    Rate Limits: Google Places API has rate limits, so ensure you handle API quotas and avoid excessive requests.
    Data Quality: Some businesses may not have complete information like phone numbers or websites, so it's essential to check and handle missing data.

Summary:

    Instagram Bot: Automates the building of an Instagram list by searching for users through hashtags and sends DMs to the list.
    Google Maps Lead Generator: Scrapes business data via the Google Places API, such as business name, address, and phone number, to generate leads.

These bots should be customized based on the specific use cases, especially considering platform restrictions and legal guidelines. Additionally, keep in mind that excessive automation can lead to account bans or violations of terms of service for both Instagram and Google.
